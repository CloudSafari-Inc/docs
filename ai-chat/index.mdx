The **AI Chat** is one of the core features of [Simbas.AI](http://Simbas.AI). It allows your team to access and retrieve information within seconds â€” dramatically reducing the time needed to build itineraries or respond to customer inquiries.

Below is a screenshot of the AI Chat interface.

The page is divided into three main components:

- **Navigation:** Located on the left side of the screen.
- **Chat:** The central area where you interact with the AI.
- **Notepad:** Positioned on the right side of the screen for saving notes, prompts, and generated content.
