The AI Chat is the powerhouse of [Simbas.AI](http://Simbas.AI) and will enable 100x operational efficiency when it comes down to accessing your knowledge base and crafting itineraries.

The AI Chat is in the middle section of the page.

### Starting a Conversation

To start a conversation, simply type into the input field where it says "Send a message...". Here are some example messages you can ask:

- "Can you check for availability at hotels in central Serengeti, Seronera area in August for 2 nights."
- "What's the cost for 2 adults and 1 child staying at Serengeti Pioneer Camp in January for 1 night"
- "Can you tell me more about Conserve Safari Serengeti, and the types of rooms that are available"

The chat is open to receiving any question that you may have. The chat currently has access to 175 hotels across Sub-Saharan Africa, which you can view at the following link:

### Time to Respond

In most cases, our systems should respond within 2 minutes when you ask a question. However, for complicated queries and questions (I.e. if asking for information across 10+ properties), this may take a longer time to run.

### AI Responses

If more detail is required from you, the AI system may request for additional information such as the age of a child, citizenship types, certain dates of travel, etc.

In the screenshot below, we asked for the rates and the AI Agent responded back further prompting for the child's age to calculate an accurate price.

### References

When you ask for information from the AI Chat - especially with costing - the AI Chat may return back references so you can be sure of the accuracy of the information.
