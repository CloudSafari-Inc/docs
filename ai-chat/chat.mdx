### **Starting a Conversation**

To start a conversation, simply type your question into the input field labeled **“Send a message…”**

Here are a few example prompts you can try:

- “Can you check for availability at hotels in central Serengeti, Seronera area in August for 2 nights?”
- “What’s the cost for 2 adults and 1 child staying at Serengeti Pioneer Camp in January for 1 night?”
- “Can you tell me more about Conserve Safari Serengeti and the types of rooms available?”

You can ask **any question** related to properties, rates, or travel details.

The AI Chat currently has access to **175+ hotels across Sub-Saharan Africa**, which you can explore here:

### Time to Respond

In most cases, [Simbas.AI](http://Simbas.AI) will respond **within 2 minutes**.

For more complex queries — for example, requests that involve **10 or more properties** — responses may take slightly longer to process.

### AI Responses

If the system requires additional details to provide an accurate answer, it will automatically **prompt you for clarification**.

This may include:

- Age of children
- Citizenship types
- Travel dates
- Room preferences

> _Example:_ When asked for rates, the AI Agent might request the child’s age to ensure pricing is calculated correctly.
