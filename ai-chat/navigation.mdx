### **AI Chat Navigation**

On the **left side** of the AI Chat interface, you’ll find the **Navigation panel**.

> _Note:_ Your navigation layout may differ slightly from the screenshot above.

The navigation panel is automatically populated based on your **past conversations** with the AI Chat. Each line item represents a **separate conversation thread**.

### New Chat

To start a new conversation, click **“New Chat.”**

This creates a **fresh conversation thread** where you can ask new questions or generate new itineraries.

We recommend using **New Chat** when:

- You want to start a new query or itinerary.
- The AI Chat gets stuck or provides unrelated responses (to reset context).
- You want to keep separate topics or client requests organized.

### Conversations

Each **line item** in the side panel represents one of your **past AI Chat conversations**.

When you start a new conversation using the **“New Chat”** button, the system will automatically assign it a **default label** to help you identify it later.

If you’d like to rename or modify a conversation:

- **Right-click** (or **double-tap** on Mac) the conversation title.
- Select **“Edit”** from the menu to update the name.

When you click **“Edit”** on a conversation, a modal will appear allowing you to:

- **Edit the conversation label** (to rename or clarify the topic)
- **Add notes** for internal reference
- **Archive the conversation** if it’s no longer active

After making your updates, click **“Save Changes”** to apply and store the new label, description, or summary.
