Within the AI chat, there's a section on the left-side which is the navigation (please note that your navigation will not look like the one in the screenshot above). The navigation is based on the conversations that you've had with the AI Chat. Each line-by-line item represents a new conversation.

### New Chat

To create a new chat, click on the button "New Chat" which will create a new conversation thread for you to ask questions. We recommend creating a "New Chat" when you want to ask new questions, create a new itinerary, if the AI Chat gets caught in a state where you need to reset the conversation, or if you just want to separate out your own logic.

### Conversations

Each line-by-line item on the side-panel represents a conversation you've had with the AI Chat. When you create a new conversation via the AI Chat (with the "New Chat" button), we'll initially label the conversation to make it easier to identify. 

If you need to edit the conversation, right click (or double-tap on a Mac) to reveal a menu to "Edit" the conversation.

Once you click on the "Edit" button, a modal will pop-up which will give you the ability to edit the conversation label, to add notes, or to archive the conversation.
