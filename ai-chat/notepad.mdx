On the AI Chat, there's a section to the right of the screen which is the AI Chat Notepad. The Notepad is your area to keep track of the notes and details from the chat. You can also use the Notepad to create an itinerary using AI.

Listed below is an example screenshot of the Notepad in use, which was used to keep track of the information from the AI Chat.

  - This is a special button which will use AI to apply the conversation to the template.
  - For example, if the template is a 3-day trip to the Serengeti National Park with set information, it will attempt to take the information from the chat to create comprehensive details on the Notepad

### Saving the Notepad

To save the Notepad click the button "Save Notes" on the bottom right of the Notepad section, which will keep the Notepad state saved for the conversation.

### Generating an Itinerary

If you've structured the Notepad to have the day-by-day breakdown or a general outline for an itinerary, you can click the button "Generate Itinerary" which will take the information from the Notepad and attempt to create an itinerary. This usually takes between 2-5 minutes to run successfully. 

Once the itinerary had been generated, you'll see a button at the top right of the Notepad section which says "View Itinerary". You can use this to view the itinerary.
