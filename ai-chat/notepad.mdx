On the **right side** of the AI Chat interface, you’ll find the **Notepad** — your workspace for capturing important notes and details from the conversation.

The Notepad allows you to:

- Keep track of key information shared during chats
- Draft and organize trip details or client notes
- Generate complete itineraries directly using AI

Below is an example screenshot of the Notepad in action, showing how it can be used to record and organize information gathered from the AI Chat.

## Notepad Templates

To simplify note-taking and quickly reference key information, you can use the **Templates** feature within the Notepad.

### **Loading and Applying Templates**

When you click **“Load Template,”** a modal will appear displaying your saved templates along with several available actions:

#### **Expand**

Expands the preview of a selected template, allowing you to review its content before applying it to the Notepad.

#### **Set Notepad**

Adds the selected template to the **end of your current Notepad** content.

Use this when you want to insert a template without overwriting existing notes.

**Apply Conversation & Notes**

This advanced option uses **AI** to automatically integrate the current chat conversation with your chosen template.

> **Example: **If you select a template for a _3-day Serengeti National Park safari_, the system will analyze your ongoing chat and fill in relevant trip details — producing a comprehensive itinerary or structured notes directly in the Notepad.

### **Saving the Notepad**

To save your notes, click **“Save Notes”** at the **bottom-right corner** of the Notepad section.

This action preserves the current state of your Notepad for that specific conversation, ensuring all your edits and references remain accessible later.

### **Generating an Itinerary**

If your Notepad contains a **day-by-day breakdown** or a **general trip outline**, you can generate a complete itinerary using AI.

Click **“Generate Itinerary”** to begin.

The system will process your notes and automatically create an itinerary — this typically takes **2 to 5 minutes** to complete.

Once the itinerary is ready, a **“View Itinerary”** button will appear in the **top-right corner** of the Notepad section.

Click this to open and review the generated itinerary.
