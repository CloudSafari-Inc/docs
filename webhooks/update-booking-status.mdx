title: 'Webhook Trip Status Update'
api: 'POST <YOUR-API-ENDPOINT>'
---

CloudSafaris will post an update for the trip status to a webhook that you supply to us.

Once an update to the trip is done on our end, we'll send a request to your supplied webhook endpoint notifying of a change to the booking status.

We will attempt to send the request up to 4 times before we will send an external email to your email on file notifying of the trip status update and the webhook failure (in the case that we don't receive an expected response).

The request parameters we will send are as follows.

### Header Parameters
<ParamField header="Authorization" type="string" default="v1" required>
  An agreed upon webhook key we'll provide to you to verify that the request is coming from us via the Authorization header in the form of a `Bearer` token.
</ParamField>

### Request Parameters
The parameters listed below are what we will send from our API to your webhook.

<ParamField body="booking_uuid" type="string" required>
    The booking uuid in reference to the trip status we're making the request for.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="trip_status" type="string" required>
    Updated status for the trip. The possible values are as follows:
    `PENDING`, `CONFIRMED`, `CANCELLED`, `COMPLETED`
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="invoiced_price" type="object">
    This is the final invoiced price that needs to be paid for the trip to be completed.
    This field only appears in the event that the booking status becomes `CONFIRMED`. 
    The price returned will always be equal to or less than the `Nett Rate` provided earlier, unless a custom request was made that required additional costs, or if a trip update was made after the booking request was sent.
    <Expandable name="properties" defaultOpen={true}>
        <ParamField body="confirmed" type="boolean">
            Whether this price was confirmed or not by the local supplier (local tour company) and our team.
        </ParamField>
        <ParamField body="price" type="number">
