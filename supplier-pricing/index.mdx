Within the [Simbas.AI](http://Simbas.AI) dashboard, the **Supplier Pricing Data** section stores pricing information from your suppliers.

This data allows your team to quickly access and query **nett** and **rack rates** directly through the **AI Chat**, ensuring faster and more accurate responses when building itineraries or quoting clients.

### Navigating to Supplier Pricing

To access this section, go to the dashboard:

üëâ https://simbas.ai/dashboard

Then, click **‚ÄúSupplier Pricing Data‚Äù** in the navigation menu.

![Screenshot2025 10 30at11 00 33AM Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-10-30at11.00.33AM.png)

There are several required fields to complete when creating supplier pricing data.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Name">
    This is the main **identifier** for the supplier pricing data.

    Choose a **clear, descriptive name** so you can easily identify and retrieve it through the AI Chat.

    > _Example:_ If you name the entry **‚ÄúSerengeti Park Fees‚Äù**, you can simply ask the AI Chat for ‚ÄúSerengeti Park Fees‚Äù to access that information.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Supplier Name">
    This is the **name of the supplier** associated with the pricing data.

    > _Example:_ If the data belongs to **Miracle Experiences** (e.g., Balloon Safari), enter **‚ÄúMiracle Experiences‚Äù** here.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Sale Rates">
    These represent the **public-facing (rack) rates** for the supplier‚Äôs pricing data.

    When you ask the AI Chat for ‚Äúpublic rates,‚Äù it references these sale rates ‚Äî serving as the **upper bound** for pricing.

    You can write this information as **plain text** and organize it using **bullet points** for clarity.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Nett Rates">
    These are the **private (nett) rates** charged by the supplier when invoicing you.

    When you ask for ‚Äúprivate rates‚Äù in the AI Chat, it will display these nett rates ‚Äî helping you calculate **profit margins** and track your actual costs.

    Like sale rates, this information can be entered as **plain text**, preferably formatted with **bullet points**.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Pricing Rules">
    Pricing rules define how a particular rate or item should be applied or calculated.

    Examples include:

    - Minimum number of travelers required to purchase the item
    - Advance purchase requirements
    - Seasonal availability (e.g., only valid during certain months)
    - Dependencies (e.g., must be purchased with another item)

    This field is **flexible and exhaustive** ‚Äî use it to document **any rules or conditions** tied to the supplier‚Äôs pricing.

    Plain text with **bullet points** is recommended for organization.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Supplier Reservation Email">
    Enter the **email address** used to make reservations or bookings with the supplier.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Booking Information Required">
    Specify the **information needed to complete a booking** for this item.

    Examples include:

    - Number of adults and children
    - Ages of children
    - Honeymoon or special occasion details
    - Full buyout options (e.g., private hot air balloon)

    As with other fields, plain text with **bullet points** works best.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Optional Checkbox">
    Indicates whether the supplier item is **mandatory or optional**.

    This setting is primarily used for the upcoming **Dynamic Itineraries** feature and does not currently affect AI Chat functionality.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Markup Checkbox">
    Determines whether the item should be **marked up** or **sold as-is** in future Dynamic Itinerary releases.

    > _Example:_ For **Government Park Fees**, you might choose _not_ to apply a markup.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Fallback Nett Markup">
    This field defines a **default markup** to apply when no **Sale (Rack)** rates are available.

    It allows you to automatically adjust the **Nett Rates** by either:

    - A **percentage** (adds the specified % on top of the Nett Rate), or
    - A **fixed amount** (adds a set value to the Nett Rate)

    This ensures consistent pricing even when public rates are missing.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


Once all information is filled out, click **‚ÄúSave‚Äù** to store the data under your organization.

> _Example:_ The screenshot below shows **Serengeti National Park Fees** added to the Supplier Pricing Data table.

### Accessing Data from the AI Chat

To retrieve supplier pricing data through the **AI Chat**, simply **search by name**.

An exact match isn‚Äôt required ‚Äî the closer the name, the easier it is for the system to identify and return the correct data.

Once located, you can ask follow-up questions to access **any or all of the details** saved when creating that supplier pricing entry.

> _Example:_ In the screenshot below, the supplier pricing data titled **‚ÄúSerengeti National Park Fees‚Äù** is searched within AI Chat to display all related information.
