title: 'Payment Processing'
---

For each trip, the final payment is to be processed after the final invoice amount is issued and the trip is confirmed. 

Due to challenges with availability in Africa, it's important that the trip is fully confirmed before processing payments from your travellers.

For each trip that gets confirmed, payment is expected to be received within 2 days of receiving the confirmation status. 

The full amount is to be sent via wire transfer to our account (details provided after establishing our partnership) which can be done either directly from the traveller or another means.
