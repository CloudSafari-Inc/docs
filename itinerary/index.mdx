The AI itinerary generator is a way for you and your team to create an itinerary within a few minutes that can be shared with a customer. This is a big help in the sale and quoting process so that you can get a quote out to a customer as soon as possible.

### Navigating

To access the AI Itinerary Generator, you can access it from one of two locations:

1. From the dashboard under "Itineraries" (https://simbas.ai/dashboard/itineraries)
2. From the AI Chat, by clicking "Generate Itinerary" after adding notes about the itinerary to the Notepad

### Generating an Itinerary from the Dashboard

To generate an itinerary from the dashboard, simply click the button "Generate Itinerary" on the dashboard for itineraries. Each itinerary also has an option to "Edit" and to "View Chat". Clicking on "Edit" will open up the itinerary in an editable view where you can then edit the itinerary as needed. Clicking "View Chat" will open up an AI Chat where the itinerary is linked to.
