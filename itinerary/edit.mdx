At the top of the itinerary page, you‚Äôll find three key toggles: **Static**, **Dynamic**, and **Publish**.

**Static**

The **Static** toggle refers to itineraries with **fixed pricing** ‚Äî ideal for quotes or packages you want to share directly with customers without automatic price adjustments.

**Dynamic**

The **Dynamic** toggle is currently in **BETA** and will be available in a future release.

This feature will enable **real-time dynamic pricing**, allowing your itineraries to automatically adjust rates based on supplier data, dates, and traveler details.

**Publish**

The **Publish** toggle controls whether an itinerary is **publicly accessible**.

When enabled, the itinerary becomes discoverable through the **search graph** and will appear on a **dedicated landing page** in a future update.
