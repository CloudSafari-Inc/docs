### Static & Publish Modes

On the top of the itinerary page, you'll see the toggles for Static/Dynamic and Publish. 

- Static refers to a fixed pricing that you can share with a customer.
- Dynamic is currently in BETA mode and is prepared for a future release, but will give you the ability to dynamically price an itinerary.
- Publish refers to making this trip publically accessible. When published, the itinerary will be available in a search graph, and on a landing page in a future iteration.

To save and share the itinerary, click on the three dots on the bottom right of the screen. This will open up a menu, where you have three options:

1. Save Itinerary
   - This will save all the changes and edits you've made to the itinerary.
2. View Private Itinerary
   - This will get you a link to the private itinerary (where you can edit the details).
3. Get Shareable Link
   - This will give you a link that you can share with a customer (it removes the ability to edit the itinerary, and removes the net cost & margin from the trip so they don't see how much you're making).
