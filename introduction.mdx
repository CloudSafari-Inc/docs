With the CloudSafaris API you can search, book, and manage trips for travellers to Sub-Saharan Africa.

<Note>
The CloudSafaris API can currently be used for trips in Kenya and Tanzania.
</Note>

### What are CloudSafaris trips?
Trips are fully-packaged itineraries that are operated by local tour companies in their respective countries (or across multiple countries). Some examples are listed below:

### How do I get access to the API?
Travel is a very crucial industry that is high-impact for many travellers. To qualify to use our API, we'll need to ensure that you meet our standards - including having the correct licensing in place.

If you feel like your company is qualified to get access to our API, please contact our team at the following email [hello@cloudsafaris.com](mailto:hello@cloudsafaris.com).

### How does my company benefit?
We've connected with several suppliers across Africa to get the best rates for various trips. With each trip, you're able to add your markup (as much as you'd like) to a trip amount to sell to your customers.

<Note>
For each trip we give you two rates, our rate, and the minimum advertised rate (rack rate). You are required to sell at the minimum advertised rate or higher.
</Note>

For each trip that gets booked, CloudSafaris manages the entire process with the local supplier end-to-end, including:

| Benefit | Description                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Payments     | CloudSafaris handles the full payment to the local tour company in Africa so you don't have to worry about distributing payments.                     |
| Up-to-date Information      | Our system is always up-to-date with the most accurate information regarding destinations, properties, trips, pricing, etc.                          |
| Operator Communication   | We communicate with the local tour companies we work with to ensure that your travellers are always covered. |
| On-ground Support   | Our team is avaiable in East Africa to ensure that your customers have a first point of contact in the event of an emergency. |
| Priority Rates   | We've established contracts with local companies to ensure that you have the best rates to sell at. |


### How much does it cost?
CloudSafaris adds a small rate on top of the base rate we get from our local suppliers - meaning we make money when you make money selling a trip. For the exact amount and a breakdown of your expected return, please [contact us](mailto:hello@cloudsafaris.com).

<Note>
If you do not meet the ratio of 1:3000 (booking per individual trip requested), each additional request made will be charged at $0.005 USD.

If you need more information on this, please contact our team.
