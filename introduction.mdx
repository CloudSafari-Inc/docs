With the CloudSafaris API you can search, book, and manage trips for travellers to Sub-Saharan Africa.

<Note>
The CloudSafaris API can currently be used for trips in Kenya and Tanzania.

### What are CloudSafaris trips?
Trips are fully-packaged itineraries that are operated by local tour companies in their respective countries (or across multiple countries). Some examples are listed below:

### How do I get access to the API?
Travel is a very crucial industry that is high-impact for many travellers. To qualify to use our API, we'll need to ensure that you meet our standards - including having the correct licensing in place.

If you feel like your company is qualified to get access to our API, please contact our team at the following email [hello@cloudsafaris.com](mailto:hello@cloudsafaris.com).

### How do I make money?
We've connected with several suppliers across Africa to get the best rates for various trips. With each trip, you're able to add your markup (as much as you'd like) to a trip amount to sell to your customers.

<Note>
For each trip we give you two rates, our rate, and the minimum advertised rate (rack rate). You are required to sell at the minimum advertised rate or higher.
